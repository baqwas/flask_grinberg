# Reference
These notes were prepared during self-paced learning. Over 20 years ago, I used to practice Flask tutorials based on Microsoft webinars! Unfortunately, I never had the bandwidth to practice what I learned. Now, with enforced involuntary retirement, I can indulge in nostalgia.  

This document uses examples from Miguel Grinberg as illustrated in his Flask Mega-Tutorial (new and improved edition, of course):
